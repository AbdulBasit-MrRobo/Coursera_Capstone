Introduction"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Whenever a person searches for a venue in a new city, they\u2019re highly interested in the best\nplaces that the city has to offer. The person might want to know how good a given restaurant\nis or the price range it falls under. This extra information would help decide which venue to\nchoose amongst the many venues in the city. Combining the location of the venues in the city\nwith their price and rating information would surely help visitors in a city make better informed\ndecisions about the places they should visit."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "This project\nexplores various venues in Vadodara and attributes the data based on user ratings and average\nprice. To explore this information, this project involves the juxtaposition of both the\nFoursquare API and the Zomato API to fetch complete information of various venues\n(including name, address, category, rating, and price). Further, a map of the venues with\nspecific color attributes will be plotted to highlight their position, and information about these\nvenues. Such plots imbibe bountiful information in the form of their colored representations\nand location on the map. This enables any visitor to take a quick glance and decide what place\nto visit."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 2. Data"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "To get location and other information about various venues in Vadodara, I used two APIs\nand decided to combine the data from both of them together. \nUsing the Foursquare\u2019s explore API (which gives venues recommendations), I fetched venues\nup to a range of 4 kilometers from the center of Vadodara and collected their names,\ncategories and locations (latitude and longitude).\nUsing the name, latitude and longitude values, I used the Zomato search API to fetch venues\nfrom its database. This API allows to find venues based on search criteria (usually the name),\nlatitude and longitude values and more. Given that the data from the two APIs did not align\ncompletely, I had to use data cleaning to combine the two datasets properly."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "To combine the two datasets, I had to check that the latitude and longitude values of each\ncorresponding venue match. After careful analysis, I decided to drop all corresponding venues\nfrom the two datasets that had their latitude and longitude values different by more than 0.0004\nfrom one another. Thus, I rounded both the latitude and longitude values up to 4 decimal places.\nThen, I calculated the difference between the corresponding latitude and longitude values and\nsaw if the difference was less than 0.0004 which should ideally mean that the two locations are\nthe same. This removed many outliers from the two datasets. Once this was done, I observed\nthat there were still some venues which were not correctly aligned."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "There were some outliers and mismatched venues and thus I dropped them.
